# Multistar-9235-Testing

This is some data and a small script that was used for testing a Multistar 9235 100Kv motor from Hobyking. A 56V <a href="https://odriverobotics.com/">Odrive</a> (firmware v0.5.1) was used to drive the motor and also to log current and voltage readings through the Odrive Python API. A force guage (<a href="http://www.extech.com/products/475044-SD">Extech 475044-SD</a>) was used to measure and log the force at the end of a small metal arm attached to the motor. All of the data was then conslidated into one Excel file.
